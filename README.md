In CS-370, I learned the role of ethics in current trends within the field as well as apply fundamental concepts of the field to solve complex problems in new ways. Computer scientists design, develop, and analyze the software and hardware used to solve problems in people's everyday tasks. These solutions help serve and enrich people's lives by making tasks more simple. As a computer scientist, you will encounter many obstacles and run into problems. The first step is to understand the problem. Once the developer finds the problem, they create a plan for how they will solve the proble. Fianlly. the developer will follow their plan to find the solution. The ethical responsibilities for a developer is to do their due diligence to ensure their products meet the highest professional standards so they can deliever a high quality product for the end-user.
